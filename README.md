This is my contribution to the Candy Jam held in 2014 in protest against King trademarking the word 
"Candy".

The code is written in Haxe to be able to compile to both desktop and mobile targets.

Since I only have a few days to get something together the code might be a bit ugly. To get started a 
bit faster I will try to use HaxePunk together with my own entity system called Seagal. This might 
change during the course of the development though...
